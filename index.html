        Setters orchestrate the attacks. They are the playmakers of the volleyball team and are analogous to point guards and quarterbacks. Their responsibilities are to run the team's attacks and build up potential scoring opportunities for the team. They aim for the second touch and their main responsibility is to place the ball in the air for the attackers to send into the opponents' court for a point.
<br>
They play both front row and back row; therefore they need to be able to both block (defending) and serve (attacking). They have to be able to operate with the spikers, manage the tempo of their team's side of the court, and choose the right attackers to set to. Setters need to be able to make quick and skillful evaluations, good communication skills and tactical accuracy and must be quick enough to move around the court.
