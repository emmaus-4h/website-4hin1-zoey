      <p>As a former powerhouse of Miyagi, Karasuno has represented the prefecture at the Spring High nationals nine
        times. One of those times was under the guidance of Coach Ikkei Ukai and Tenma Udai (the little Giant).
        <br>However, after Karasuno's initial success, they failed
        to pass its prefecture's preliminaries in future tournaments
        and
        therefore received the derogatory nicknames "The Fallen Champions" and "The Flightless Crows."
